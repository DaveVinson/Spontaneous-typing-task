“plot-summary” the experiment itself used to collect data can be found here: davevinson.com/exp/plot-summary/

“Analysis” contains a “0-master-script.R” and “0-master-script-app.R” for the main paper and appendix respectively. both will can be used as a guide to each of the other .R files used to clean and analyze our data. 

“data” contains data files, but also some .R code used to clean these files. We run these files first, saving “keystrokes.RData” to each data folder. other files are saved to this to generate each dataset’s figures (from analysis section). 

The manuscript provides an overview of our findings. This was submitted to Cognition. Please do not cite, or distribute without permission.
