The “plot-summary” folder contains the experimental setup and designed used to run this study. You can see this in action here: davevinson.com/exp/plot-summary/ 


The "data" folder contains the main experiment as well as replication experiments at different times and from different participant pools (e.g., a university participant pool, and a more general Amazon Turk participant pool). included are three .R files that are used to “clean” and “generate” the cleaned data files used for the final analysis. 

The “Analysis” folder contains all files used to analyze the data in “data”. You will need to reroute the “root folder” in “0-master-script.R” to the appropriate data file you wish to analyze.
